Arm and Arm Diseases


Information:


The human arm is composed of bones, joints, and muscles 
that allow us to perform a wide range of movements, including 
reaching, grasping, and throwing. The bones of the arm include 
the humerus in the upper arm, and the radius and ulna in the 
lower arm, which articulate at the elbow joint. The wrist joint 
is formed by the radius and a row of small bones called the 
carpal bones, while the hand is composed of the metacarpal bones 
and the phalanges of the fingers.

Common diseases of the arm skeleton include 
fractures, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, carpal tunnel 
syndrome, and tennis elbow. Fractures can occur in any of the bones 
of the arm due to trauma or repetitive stress. Osteoarthritis is a 
degenerative joint disease that can affect the elbow or 
wrist joints, causing pain and stiffness. Rheumatoid arthritis is an 
autoimmune disorder that can also affect the elbow and 
wrist joints, causing inflammation and deformity. Carpal tunnel syndrome
is a condition that results from compression of the 
median nerve as it passes through 
the wrist, causing numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand. 
Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition that 
results from repetitive stress on the tendons that attach to the 
lateral epicondyle of the elbow, causing pain and weakness in the 
forearm and hand.
