Kidneys and Common Kidney Diseases:

Information:

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located on either side of 
the spine in the back of the abdominal cavity. They play a crucial 
role in the body's urinary system and help filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood. The primary function of the kidneys is to produce urine, which is then transported to the bladder and eliminated from the body through the urethra.

Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidneys gradually 
lose function over time, usually over the course of months or years. 
It can lead to a variety of complications, including high 
blood pressure, anemia, and nerve damage.

Kidney stones are hard, mineral deposits that form inside the 
kidneys and can cause intense pain and discomfort when they pass 
through the urinary tract. The most common cause of kidney stones 
is dehydration, which can cause minerals and salts to crystallize 
and form stones.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria that enter the 
urinary tract and can lead to symptoms such as painful 
urination, frequent urination, and lower abdominal pain. 
Headache is not typically a symptom of a UTI.

Several factors can increase the risk of chronic kidney 
disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and 
a family history of kidney disease.

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate, which forms 
when there is too much calcium and oxalate in the urine.

The main treatment for kidney failure is dialysis, which is a process 
that filters waste products and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys can no longer perform this function.

The nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys and are 
responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood.

Symptoms of chronic kidney disease can include high blood 
pressure, swelling of the legs and feet, and fatigue.

Kidney disease can be prevented by maintaining a healthy 
lifestyle, including drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced 
diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring blood pressure and 
blood sugar levels regularly.
