Skull and Common Diseases


Information:

The human skull is the structure that forms the head and protects the brain. It consists of 22 bones, 8 of which are cranial bones that enclose the brain and 14 are facial bones that support the face and provide attachment sites for the teeth and muscles. The skull also contains several foramina, or openings, through which nerves, blood vessels, and other structures pass.

Common diseases that can affect the skull include skull fractures, which can occur as a result of a head injury; craniosynostosis, a birth defect where one or more of the cranial sutures close prematurely, leading to an abnormally shaped skull; and osteomyelitis, a bone infection that can occur in any bone in the body, including the skull. Other conditions that can affect the skull include tumors, such as meningiomas and gliomas, and conditions that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), such as temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), which can cause pain and discomfort in the jaw and head.
