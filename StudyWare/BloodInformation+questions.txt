Blood and Common Blood Diseases.

INFORMATION:

Blood is a vital fluid that circulates throughout the body, transporting oxygen and nutrients to the organs and tissues, while also removing waste products. It is composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

There are several common blood diseases that can affect the normal functioning of blood. Some of them are:

1. Anemia: This is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough red blood cells or hemoglobin, which leads to a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be carried by the blood.

2. Hemophilia: This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to clot blood, which can result in excessive bleeding even from minor injuries.

3. Leukemia: This is a type of cancer that affects the blood-forming tissues in the body, such as the bone marrow and lymphatic system.

4. Thrombocytopenia: This is a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough platelets, which can result in excessive bleeding.

5. Sickle cell anemia: This is an inherited blood disorder in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped, leading to decreased oxygen flow to the body's tissues.
