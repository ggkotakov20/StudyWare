Nervous System and Common Diseases

Information:

The human nervous system is a complex network of nerves and cells 
that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It has two 
main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral 
nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal 
cord, while the PNS includes all the nerves outside of the brain and 
spinal cord.

The PNS can be further divided into the somatic nervous system and the 
autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system is responsible for 
voluntary movements and is involved in sensory perception, while the 
autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions like 
heart rate, breathing, and digestion.

The human body contains millions of individual nerve cells called 
neurons, which transmit electrical signals throughout the body. 
Neurons are composed of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. 
The dendrites receive signals from other neurons, while the axon sends 
signals to other neurons or to muscles and glands.

Damage to nerves can result in a variety of conditions, such as 
neuropathies, which are characterized by pain, numbness, or weakness 
in the affected area. Examples of neuropathies include carpal tunnel 
syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
