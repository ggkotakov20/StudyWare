Stomach and Common Stomach Diseases

Information:

The stomach is a muscular sac located in the upper left abdomen, between the esophagus and the small intestine. It plays a crucial role in the digestive system by breaking down food into smaller particles and mixing it with gastric acid and enzymes.

Common stomach diseases include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, gastritis, and stomach cancer. GERD is a chronic condition in which the stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and damage to the esophageal lining. Peptic ulcers are open sores that form in the lining of the stomach or small intestine, often caused by a bacterial infection or the long-term use of certain medications. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining, which can be caused by infections, alcohol, stress, or the use of certain medications. Stomach cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells lining the stomach and can spread to other parts of the body.

Other common digestive issues that can affect the stomach include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, and food intolerances or allergies. IBS is a chronic condition that affects the large intestine and can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, causing damage to the small intestine. Food intolerances or allergies can cause a range of digestive symptoms, including stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.
