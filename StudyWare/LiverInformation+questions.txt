Liver and Common Liver Diseases


The liver is the largest internal organ and has many important 
functions, including filtering blood, producing bile, storing 
vitamins and minerals, and breaking down toxins. Here are 
some common liver diseases:

1.Hepatitis: Inflammation of the liver caused 
by a viral infection or exposure to toxins.
2.Cirrhosis: A progressive disease that occurs 
when liver cells are damaged and replaced by scar tissue, leading to 
loss of liver function.
3.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A condition 
where fat builds up in the liver, often seen in people 
with obesity, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels.
