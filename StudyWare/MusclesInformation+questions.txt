Muscles and Common Muscle Diseases

Information:

Human muscles are the collection of tissues in the body responsible 
for movement, maintaining posture, and generating heat. There are 
three main types of muscles in the human body: skeletal, smooth, and 
cardiac muscles.

Skeletal muscles are attached to the bones and are responsible for 
voluntary movement. They are striated muscles and are under conscious 
control. Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs 
such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels, and they are 
responsible for involuntary movements such as peristalsis. 
Cardiac muscles are found only in the heart and are responsible for 
pumping blood throughout the body.

Common muscle diseases include 
muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, fibromyalgia, and polymyositis. 
Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that cause 
progressive muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass. 
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes 
muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the eyes, face, throat, and
limbs. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that affects 
muscles, tendons, and ligaments, causing widespread pain, fatigue, and 
sleep disturbances. Polymyositis is an autoimmune disease that causes 
inflammation and weakness in the muscles, particularly in the 
hips, thighs, shoulders, and neck.
