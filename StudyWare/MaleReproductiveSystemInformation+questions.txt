Male Reproductive System and Common Diseases


Information:

The male reproductive system consists of organs that are involved in the production, storage, and transportation of sperm. These organs include the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and urethra. The testes produce sperm and testosterone, while the epididymis stores and transports sperm to the vas deferens, which carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The seminal vesicles and prostate gland produce seminal fluid, which nourishes and transports sperm during ejaculation.

Common diseases that can affect the male reproductive system include prostate cancer, testicular cancer, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Prostate cancer is a cancer that affects the prostate gland and can cause problems with urination and sexual function. Testicular cancer is a cancer that affects the testicles and can cause pain, swelling, and lumps in the scrotum. Erectile dysfunction is a condition where a man is unable to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual activity. Infertility is a condition where a man is unable to father a child due to problems with sperm production or transportation.
