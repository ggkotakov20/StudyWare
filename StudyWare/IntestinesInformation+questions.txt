Intestines and Common Diseases


Information:

The human intestine, also known as the bowel, is part of the digestive system responsible for absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste from the body. The small intestine is the longest part of the digestive tract, where most nutrient absorption occurs. The large intestine, or colon, absorbs water and electrolytes from undigested food and stores waste until elimination.

Common diseases of the intestines include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticulitis, and colon cancer. IBD is a chronic inflammation of the digestive tract that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBS is a functional disorder that causes abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of small pouches in the lining of the colon, while colon cancer is the growth of cancerous cells in the colon or rectum.
