Heart and Common Heart Diseases:

The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body, supplying the organs and tissues with oxygen and nutrients. Here are some common heart diseases:

1. Coronary artery disease: A condition where the arteries that supply 
blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked.
2. Arrhythmia: A heart rhythm problem that can cause the heart to beat 
too fast, too slow, or irregularly.
3. Heart failure: A condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood 
to meet the body's needs.
4. Atherosclerosis: A condition where plaque builds up inside the 
arteries, causing them to harden and narrow.
5. Heart valve disease: A condition where one or more of the heart 
valves do not function properly.
